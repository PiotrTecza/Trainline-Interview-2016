Tools:
Visual Studio 2015 - C# 6.0
Nuget packages will be downloaded automatically during the build

Decisions taken:

- Creating separate CSVReader and CSVWriter
- Because backward compatibility of CSVReaderWriter was required, its interface was unchanged but it was marked as Obsolete and it's only a wrapper for new classes.
  I added parameterless constructor with creation of required classes (this could be encapsulated in Factory) and also added second constructor that could be used if DI were supported
- Because .Net does not provide abstractions for System.IO, custom wrappers were created. There are ready nuget packages serving that purpose but they don't cover
  everything, for example StreamWriter.WriteLine(). I didn't want to change the logic to use StreamWriter.Write() and Environment.NewLine, so I created minimal
  implementation to suffice needs of this refactoring.
- Only new classes are covered by unit tests.
